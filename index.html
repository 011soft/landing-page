<!--
    Hello!
    This is the landing page for a work-in-progress
    application called "Snacker".
    Snacker is a two-part toolkit, with both a data-
    base and a GUI. The goal is to have a public,
    community-driven, highly-informative database
    with as much dietary info as we can cram in.

    The GUI will be an application that takes all of
    this information, and puts it into a user-
    friendly interface to allow users to track their
    diets with unrivaled ease and precision.

    If this sounds cool to you, be sure to let us
    know at hello@snacker.dev, and follow our
    GitHub. Cheers!
-->
